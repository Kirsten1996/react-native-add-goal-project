This is my first React Native app. Here I have a simple add/delete goal project, on the home page you can click on the app button that bring up a modal that has an input for you to add a goal and then you'll be returned to the home page and if you click on the goal it will then be deleted

1. To get started clone this project

2. Check out the .nvmrc file to ensure you're using the correct node -v

3. Run ```npm install``` to install packages

4. Run ```npm start``` to start up the app
